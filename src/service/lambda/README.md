# Simulated Lambda implementation

This directory contains the simulated Lambda service implementation.

The implementation focuses on Lambda behaviour that is useful for isolated tests and local
development: creating functions and invoking them in-process. It does not try to reproduce every
Lambda feature, but supported behaviour should be predictable and AWS-like enough that application
code can interact with it through familiar AWS SDK commands.

## Entry points

- `sim-lambda.ts` is the main in-memory service object for one account/region scope.
- `index.ts` exports the public Lambda simulator API for `@kensio/yulin/lambda`.

A `SimLambda` instance owns an in-memory map of functions:

```typescript
Map<SimLambdaFunctionName, SimLambdaFunction>;
```

The simulator is scoped to an AWS account and region. Function ARNs are built from that scope, so a
function created in account `666666666666` and region `eu-west-2` gets an ARN like:

```text
arn:aws:lambda:eu-west-2:666666666666:function:greeter
```

When used through `SimAws`, Lambda is available from account/region containers, for example
`simAws.lambda()`, `simAws.account("...").lambda()`, or
`simAws.account("...").region("...").lambda()`.

## Command handling

AWS SDK-style operations are implemented under `command/`.

Each supported command has its own directory containing:

- command input/output typing
- a handler that applies validation, IAM authorization, and state changes
- tests for the simulated command behaviour

As with other service implementations, implementation code under `src/` should not import real AWS
SDK packages. Instead, the simulator defines minimal structural interfaces that match the shape of
the AWS SDK command objects closely enough for users and tests to pass in real SDK command
instances.

Current command areas include:

- `create-function/`
- `get-function/`
- `invoke/`

The main `SimLambda` class delegates command execution to handlers rather than keeping command
handling logic inline.

## Function model

Function state lives under `function/`.

`SimLambdaFunction` is the stored simulated resource: name, execution role ARN, scope, AWS-like
configuration metadata, and the real handler function reference that backs it. A new function
starts in the `Pending` state and becomes `Active` asynchronously via the shared
`BackgroundScheduler`, mirroring how real Lambda creation returns before the function is ready.

### Function code input

Real Lambda receives function code as a zipped bundle in `Code.ZipFile`. The simulator currently
supports a real handler function reference instead, smuggled through the SDK-shaped input with the
same `Uint8Array` "stowaway" trick used by simulated CloudFront Functions:

```typescript
new CreateFunctionCommand({
  FunctionName: "greeter",
  Role: "arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/GreeterRole",
  Code: {
    ZipFile: makeLambdaZipFileInput(
      async (event: { name: string }) => `Hello ${event.name}`,
    ),
  },
});
```

`function/code/lambda-zip-file-input.ts` owns this: `makeLambdaZipFileInput(...)` wraps the handler
in a `Uint8Array` subclass, and `LambdaZipFileExtractor` recovers it at creation time. The
extractor is the seam where future code inputs belong — source code strings run in a `vm` context
(as simulated CloudFront Functions already support), and eventually real zipped bundles produced by
CloudFormation or CDK packaging. Real zip bytes currently fail with a clear sim-specific error.

### Handler typing and completion styles

`function/sim-lambda-handler.type.ts` defines `SimLambdaHandler` and `SimLambdaContext` as minimal
structural equivalents of the `aws-lambda` typings package's `Handler` and `Context`, so real typed
handlers can be passed in unchanged. `SimLambdaHandlerRunner` mirrors the Node.js runtime's
completion styles: returning a promise, returning a plain value synchronously, calling the
callback, or using the legacy context `done`/`fail`/`succeed` methods.

## Invocation

`InvokeCommand` supports the three AWS invocation types:

- `RequestResponse` (default): parses the JSON payload into the handler event, awaits the handler,
  and returns the JSON-serialised result as the response payload. A handler error is reported
  AWS-style with `FunctionError: "Unhandled"` and an error document payload rather than a thrown
  error.
- `Event`: returns `202` immediately and runs the handler asynchronously via the
  `BackgroundScheduler`; handler errors are dropped (failure destinations are not simulated yet).
- `DryRun`: returns `204` without invoking the handler.

### Execution role

Creating a function requires an execution `Role` ARN, as on real AWS. While a handler runs,
`SimLambdaFunction.invoke` uses the ambient caller mechanism
(`src/service/aws/caller/sim-aws-run-as-context.ts`) to run the handler with the execution role as
the ambient simulated caller for the owning `SimAws` instance. Simulated AWS operations performed
inside the handler — including SDK commands routed through `SimSdk` interception — are therefore
attributed to the execution role and evaluated against simulated IAM, just like real Lambda
execution roles.

A standalone `SimLambda` (constructed directly rather than through `SimAws`) is its own run-as
owner, keeping its ambient callers isolated.

## IAM authorization

Command handlers authorize with per-command authorizers against the function ARN, using the
account-scoped simulated IAM implementation when constructed through `SimAws`
(`lambda:CreateFunction`, `lambda:GetFunction`, `lambda:InvokeFunction`), with the same
allow-all fallback as other services for direct standalone construction.

## Not simulated yet

- CloudFormation `AWS::Lambda::*` resource creation (no `cfn/` directory yet)
- function code as source strings or real zipped bundles
- versions, aliases and qualifiers
- timeouts interrupting handler execution
- asynchronous invocation retries and failure destinations
